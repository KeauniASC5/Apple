        <p>How did Apple rise?</p>

                As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing
                 sales due to lower-priced products from competitors,
                 in particular those offered with the Microsoft Windows operating system.
                  More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO Gil Amelio in 1997 decided to buy NeXT to bring Jobs back.
                   Jobs regained position as CEO and began a process to rebuild Apple's status,
                    which included opening Apple's own retail stores in 2001,
                     making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles,
                      and changing some of the hardware used in its computers.
                       It again saw success and returned to profitability. 
                       In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. 
                       would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics.
                        He also announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success.
                         In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. 
                         Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company.
