                Apple is the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer
                 after Samsung and Huawei. In August 2018, Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over US$1 trillion.
                  The company employs 123,000 full-time employees and maintains 499 retail stores in 22 countries as of December 2017. 
                  It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music retailer. 
                  As of January 2016, more than one billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide.
Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $229 billion for the 2017 fiscal year.
 The company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty and has been repeatedly ranked as the world's most valuable brand.
  However, it receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors,
  its environmental and business practices, including anti-competitive behavior, as well as the origins of source materials.
